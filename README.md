The Biochemistry of Tumors

## Description

Biochemistry of Cancer focuses on cancer research, including induction, chemical composition, and growth of tumors and chemotherapy. The book first offers information on the general phenomena and taxonomy of cancer. Discussions focus on the transmissibility of tumors and experimental basis of cancer research; cancerous transformation of animal tissues in vitro; growth and the vascular reactions of tumors; and classification of animal tumors. The text also ponders on the extrinsic factors in the induction of tumors, including comparative carcinogenicity of hydrocarbons, metabolic fate of injected hydrocarbons, dosage and response to carcinogenic hydrocarbons, and polycyclic hydrocarbons. The manuscript takes a look at the intrinsic factors in the induction of tumors. Topics include influence of sex hormones on carcinogenesis of sex and accessory sex tissues; viruses as causative agents for fowl tumors and rabbit papillomas; and possibility of relatively non-specific endogenous carcinogens. The publication also elaborates on attempts to control tumor induction and growth and the chemistry of tumors. The book is a vital reference for readers interested in the biochemistry of cancer.
